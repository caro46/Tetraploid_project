# [LINKS](https://github.com/bcgsc/LINKS)

As suggested in a [github issue](https://github.com/bcgsc/LINKS/issues/15), needed to comment out 
```
Is /usr/lib/perl5/core_perl/CORE the correct path matching your version of PERL?

Also, keep in mind you do not need the Bloom filter functionality if you are only going to use LINKS pipelined with ARCS or ARKS:

You could simply comment out these lines (if only using LINKS with ARC/KS):

#use lib "$FindBin::Bin/./lib/bloomfilter/swig";
#use BloomFilter;
```
Couldn't make the script run without error even with having everything needed in the path and also specified using `perl -I`.

Installed on compute canada. Tried to load the modules but still doesn't work:
```
module load nixpkgs/16.09
module load links/1.8.5
```
