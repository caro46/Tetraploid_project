# [LINKS](https://github.com/bcgsc/LINKS)

As suggested in a [github issue](https://github.com/bcgsc/LINKS/issues/15), needed to comment out 
```
Is /usr/lib/perl5/core_perl/CORE the correct path matching your version of PERL?

Also, keep in mind you do not need the Bloom filter functionality if you are only going to use LINKS pipelined with ARCS or ARKS:

You could simply comment out these lines (if only using LINKS with ARC/KS):

#use lib "$FindBin::Bin/./lib/bloomfilter/swig";
#use BloomFilter;
```
Couldn't make the script run without error even with having everything needed in the path and also specified using `perl -I`.

Installed on compute canada. Tried to load the modules but still doesn't work:
```
module load nixpkgs/16.09
module load links/1.8.5
```
26/02: installed Links on Iqaluk without issue and gave a try using parameters used for *P. glauca* in the example. Very poor results. Need to adjust `d` and `t`.

27/02: run quast to check on new assembly statistics

## 1st try - *P. glauca* parameters

The genome of the white spruce size is ~20 Gbp. It is the biggest genome from the example set. In the example set, `LINKS` was used to re-scaffold the draft genome using another draft genome (so ~1X coverage). Having a "low" coverage from the corrected (from the canu assembly preliminary step) pacbio reads, I thought the same parameters would make sense to try as a 1st step to see how the program behave. Smaller values of `-d` and `-t` should be used later considering the poor scaffolding result but it will increase the RAM usage.

### Commands
`running_links_mello_canu.sh` to run iteratively each time on the new assembly produced: parameters used: 

- `-d` = `5000`, `7500`, `10000`, `12500`, `15000`, `20000`, `30000`, `40000`, `50000`, `60000`, `70000`, `80000`, `90000`, `100000` 

- with respectively `-t` = `200`, `200`, `150`, `150`, `150`, `75`, `50` (`50` for the other values of `-d`)

- `-k 26 -l 5 -a 0.3`

Some of the 1st commands run used (see [running_links_mello_canu.sh](https://github.com/caro46/Tetraploid_project/blob/master/some_scripts/running_links_mello_canu.sh) to have the complete commands)

Mainly longer scaffolds, a little bit less but same N50. Hoping to have better results using mate pairs and long reads from LoRDEC.
