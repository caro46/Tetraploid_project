As suggested in a [github issue](https://github.com/bcgsc/LINKS/issues/15), needed to comment out 
```
#use lib "$FindBin::Bin/./lib/bloomfilter/swig";
#use BloomFilter;
```
Couldn't make the script run without error even with having everything needed in the path and also specified using `perl -I`.
